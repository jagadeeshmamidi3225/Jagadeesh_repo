# 👋 Hi, I'm Jagadeesh

## 🚀 Embedded Firmware  Engineer

I am a **hands-on Embedded Systems Engineer** with strong experience in **bare‑metal firmware development**, **STM32 microcontrollers**, and **FPGA-based designs**. I enjoy working close to the hardware—writing drivers from scratch, understanding registers deeply, and building protocols without relying on high-level abstractions.

## 🧠 What I Work On

* Bare‑metal firmware for **STM32 (F4 series)**
* **RTOS‑based embedded applications**
* **FPGA-based designs and interfaces**
* Hardware‑software co‑design
* Debugging at **register, bus, and timing level**
